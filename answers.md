1.  What was the important theme for this chapter?

Dave: chapter 10 - The document hypothesis

The theme is that documents are critical b/c they clarify the plan and capture changes.   They are refering to the PRD or MRD document.  Oh lord this sounds oh so familiar!  I've spent my entire career writing requirement documents. 

2. How does this chapter tie in what what you know about development in this stage in your career?

The key is to have a plan before writing code.   Have a list of requirements, a wireframe, and an idea of what functionality it should included as an MVP. 


3. What was the most important lesson you learned in this chapter?

That the right documents are key to the success of the project.  The right documents, in their clarity and precision, communicate the required functionality to the team of developers. 


4. Do you feel that this chapter is still applicable to development today?  Why or Why not?

Ha ha, funny you should ask!  The notion of write product requirements has evolved and the latest and greatest approach are visual, interactive wireframes (or mockups) with annotations that capture the product requirements.  The best way to communicate the plan to an implementer is to show them. 

This topic is so relavant in the era of email overload.   Workflow apps like Asana and Trello attempt to minimize the amount of email we sent, but there is still an information overload.  The theme is that less is more.  A few good documents that are accessible, easy to navigate, and clear, and key.  

For example even the classic PRD is outdated and obsolete compared to visual wireframe requirement documents, especially for web apps that are highly visual. 


5. Where there any revelations you had from reading this chapter?

So weird to hear about documenting requirements BEFORE the profession of product management even existed!

Back in the mainframe days the plan was created by an architect, ie the surgeon.  Today, we have segmented the business and technical sides a bit.  But a few product leaders are also technically involved (ahem, like me!). 



6. How awesome is this book?!!?

It's crazy old.   It's valuable, but Getting Real may be even more pertinent.  There are some great lessons there like less is more, small teams are more effective than large teams, etc.  But Getting Real is just a derivative of TMMM, I'm sure.
